# Contributing to Astolfo Forge mod

## 1. Suggestions

The simplest you can do for now is to just create an idea suggestion for the mod over at my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/b2YpubtbGR) or using a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Akatsuki2555/AstolfoForge/issues). 

## 2. Reporting bugs

If you find any bug in the mod, you can report it on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/b2YpubtbGR) or using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Akatsuki2555/AstolfoForge/issues) for it to be fixed. It will be fixed once I get some free time.

## 3. Forking

If you have the time and skill in MCreator, you can fork the repository, make your changes and open a pull request to add your feature. You'll be displayed as a contributor on GitHub and be put in the description in a list of contributors.

# Code formatting guidelines

## Code formatting

Since this is written in MCreator, there are almost no code formatting guidelines to follow. I ask you to please make sure your code written in blocks is as readable as possible, so please avoid creating long blocks and instead prefer creating really tall ones, which are easier to follow.

## Short and straight to the point commit messages

Make sure your commit messages make sense, are short and describe your work straight to the point. For example, don't use `Fixed bug`, instead append a short description of what bug you've fixed, like `Fixed Astolfo being way too fast` for example. When adding features, it's enough to just use the feature name, like `Added Felix` is enough.

## Limit the number of commits

Avoid unnecessary commits, and when you develop locally, instead of commiting and pushing your work immediately, commit it only, test it locally and if you find any bugs, fix them and then amend your commit to have one commit instead of 2 commits. Similarly, you can create a branch on your fork, do as many commits as possible, then open a pull request from that branch to the main branch of your fork, and use "Merge and Squash" instead of the default "Merge" operation.
